--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, 
   and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.   
          constructor(title,studio,rating){
          this.title=title
          this.studio=studio
          this.rating=rating
          }

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.    
          getrating(){
          return this.rating

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the 
   input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG13”
      const obj1=new movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG­13")


full code: 
class movie{
constructor(title,studio,rating){
this.title=title
this.studio=studio
this.rating=rating
}
getrating(){
return this.rating
}}
const obj1=new movie("Casino Royale","Eon Productions","PG­13")
